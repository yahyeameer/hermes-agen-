"""The deployment seam: what a tenant declares becomes IAM, and what it must never become.

The refusals carry the weight here. ``ARCHITECTURE_BOUNDARIES.md`` §6 promises that agents
never receive broad access to a customer's AWS account; these tests are what makes that a
control rather than a sentence. Each one names the shape of grant that would break the
promise, because the realistic failure is not malice — it is somebody resolving an
AccessDenied at five o'clock by widening the thing that denied them.
