"""NOVA's channel output, fed to the runtime's own configuration and routing engine.

Not a stub anywhere. `parse_profile_routes`, `match_profile_route` and `load_gateway_config`
are the runtime's, and what they receive is whatever NOVA actually compiled. That matters
because the entire architecture rests on one claim — *a NOVA agent id is a runtime profile
name, so a declared channel routes with no glue* — and the only honest way to check a claim
like that is to hand the output to the thing that will consume it.

They skip when the runtime is not importable, which is the normal state of NOVA's own test
environment: the layer is meant to install without it.
