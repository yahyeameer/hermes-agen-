# NOVA Channel Security Model

A channel is the first thing in this product that a stranger can send bytes to. Everything
else — the control plane, the work board, the knowledge index — is reached by someone who
already holds a credential. A connected WhatsApp number is reachable by anybody who knows the
number, and the message they send becomes the text a worker reads.

So this document is written as a threat model rather than a feature list, and it is explicit
about which defences are the runtime's, which are NOVA's, and which do not exist yet.

## 1. Trust boundaries

```
  anyone on the internet
          │
          │  (1) provider authentication + webhook signature   ← RUNTIME
          ▼
   provider adapter
          │
          │  (2) sender allowlist, default-deny                ← RUNTIME
          ▼
   inbound routing
          │
          │  (3) route → agent, refused if agent not served    ← RUNTIME, fed by NOVA
          ▼
   the agent's profile
          │
          │  (4) tool policy, knowledge scope, delegation      ← NOVA (Phases 2–5)
          ▼
   the model
```

**NOVA owns (3)'s input and nothing else on this path.** That is deliberate: (1) and (2) are
implemented, tested and battle-worn in the runtime, and a second implementation would be a
second thing to get wrong.

---

## 2. What the runtime already defends against

Verified by reading the implementation during the Phase 9 audit; file references are in
`NOVA_CHANNEL_AUDIT.md`.

| Threat | Defence | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Forged webhook | HMAC-SHA256, Svix-compatible signatures, constant-time compare | `gateway/platforms/webhook.py` |
| Replay of a captured webhook | Signed timestamp checked against a replay window; unparseable → reject | `_timestamp_fresh` |
| Duplicate delivery | Idempotency cache, 1-hour TTL, bounded | `webhook.py:178` |
| Oversized body | Cap checked **before** the body is read | `webhook.py` module docstring |
| Unknown sender | **Default-deny.** No allowlist → denied; an adapter's own policy is trusted only when it is a real allowlist, never when it is `open` | `base.py:1889` |
| Cross-profile credential theft | `get_secret` returns the scoped value or the default, never another profile's; **raises** when unscoped under multiplexing | `agent/secret_scope.py:110` |
| Lost response after a crash | Durable obligation ledger; an ambiguous send is redelivered with a visible recovered marker rather than silently | `gateway/delivery_ledger.py` |

**NOVA adds nothing to this list and must not claim to.**

## 3. What NOVA adds

### 3.1 The grant — a connection may reach only declared agents

The runtime routes a conversation to a profile. Nothing in it says *which* profiles a
connection is allowed to reach, so a route edited by hand could point a customer WhatsApp
line at an internal finance agent and the runtime would deliver it correctly.

NOVA's `allowed_agents` is that missing statement, and it is enforced twice:

1. **At parse time.** A route naming an agent outside the grant is refused, with the
   connection id and the agent named.
2. **In the runtime's own fail-closed check.** The grant compiles into
   `gateway.multiplex_profile_allowlist`, and `gateway/run.py` refuses a route whose target
   profile is not served: *"Rejecting profile route %r: target profile %r is not served"*.

The second one is the one that matters. A validation somebody bypasses by editing YAML is
advice; a runtime that will not deliver is a control.

### 3.2 Credentials NOVA cannot hold

A channel declaration **cannot express a secret**. `token`, `api_key`, `secret`, `password`,
`credential` and `app_secret` are refused at parse time, at any nesting depth, and the
compiler refuses them a second time before handing settings to the runtime. Any existing
`token:` in the runtime's own platform config is **stripped** from the file NOVA writes.

Credential *variable names* come from the provider catalogue and an author cannot override
them — an author who could choose the name could choose one the adapter never reads, and the
failure would present as a broken channel rather than a misconfiguration.

Values live in `<profile>/.env`, which is on `materialize.NEVER_WRITE`. Verified on a live
deployment: the value appears **zero times** in the control API response and **zero times** in
NOVA's audit log, which does not even record the variable's name.

### 3.3 Connecting a channel is model-visible, and logged write-ahead

An inbound message becomes the text a worker reads, exactly as a work item's body does. So
`channel.connected` is a `MODEL_VISIBLE_KIND` and goes through `audit.model_visible_change` —
intent before, committed after — recorded against the **named human** who connected it, not
the process. That is what answers *"when did this channel start reaching that agent"* after
an incident, which is the question nobody can reconstruct later without a record.

### 3.4 Authorization on the control plane

| Action | Role | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Read `/channels` | `viewer` | Operational state, and it contains no credential — only variable names and which are absent |
| `POST /channels/apply` | `admin` | Makes the runtime start delivering to agents |

Separate tables, as Phase 8 established: reading what is connected and changing who it
reaches are different permissions. The write inherits the CSRF defences, the body cap, the
JSON content-type requirement and the audit-or-refuse rule already built for work decisions.

## 4. Residual risk — stated, not solved

These are real and they are **not** fixed by this phase. Listing them is the point.

| # | Risk | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The default profile shares the process environment.** Under multiplexing, secondary profiles are credential-scoped and fail closed; the default profile falls back to `os.environ`. Two agents both holding channel credentials are isolated only if neither is the default profile. | **Live.** Same boundary the Phase 6 readiness audit found for model credentials. Mitigate by giving every channel-bearing agent a named profile. |
| 2 | **Inbound is not durable.** Outbound has a ledger; inbound has a 1-hour idempotency cache. A message arriving while the gateway is down is lost unless the provider retries. | **Live.** NOVA must never claim "durable messaging". |
| 3 | **Sender identity is not authorization.** The runtime's allowlist is per-platform env (`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`), not per-NOVA-connection. NOVA does not yet model which *humans* may reach a channel. | **Live.** Today: set the platform allowlist. |
| 4 | **A webhook provider needs a public HTTPS endpoint.** WhatsApp Cloud requires one; exposing it is a deployment decision with its own attack surface, and the AWS module does not open it. | **Live.** Surfaced as `needs_public_endpoint` on the provider and in the dashboard. |
| 5 | **No per-channel rate limit in NOVA.** The runtime rate-limits some adapters; NOVA adds no cost ceiling, and cannot — a token ceiling is structurally impossible on this runtime (`BUDGET_ENFORCEMENT_AUDIT.md`). | **Live.** Cost control is the provider's console. |
| 6 | **No human-approval gating per channel yet.** The phase brief sketches "human approval required for discounts, refunds, contract changes". The policy layer can express tool approvals today; binding them *per channel* is not built. | **Not built.** Recommended next phase. |
| 7 | **Prompt injection from an inbound message.** A stranger's text reaches a model. The existing tool policy and knowledge scoping bound what that model may then *do*, which is the real mitigation; nothing sanitises the text itself. | **Live and inherent.** Any channel product has this. The defence is that the agent's permissions are declared and fail closed. |

## 5. What an attacker gets from each thing they might steal

- **The channel declaration file.** Agent names, conversation ids, provider names. No
  credential — by construction, tested.
- **The generated gateway config.** The same, plus which agents the gateway serves. No
  credential — the merge strips `token` and `api_key`.
- **NOVA's audit log.** Who connected what and when. No credential, and not even the
  variable names.
- **A control-plane viewer token.** The channel list, including which variables are missing.
  Useful reconnaissance; no secret, and no ability to connect or reroute.
- **`<profile>/.env`.** Everything for that one agent's channels. This is the file the whole
  design pushes secrets into precisely so that it is the *only* one worth stealing, and it is
  the one NOVA never writes, never reads the values of, and never archives by default.
