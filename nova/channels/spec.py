"""What a customer declares when they connect a channel.

The audit found the runtime already routes a chat to a profile. What it does not have — and
what a commercial product cannot ship without — is a statement that *this connection may only
reach these agents*. A route says where a message goes; it never says where a message is
allowed to go, and those become different the moment somebody edits a route.

So the grant is the centre of this module. ``allowed_agents`` is declared per connection,
every route is checked against it, and a route naming an agent outside the grant is refused
at parse time rather than compiled into infrastructure and discovered later.

**No secret is ever expressible here.** A channel declaration carries provider ids, chat ids,
agent names and display text. The credential variable names come from the provider catalogue,
which NOVA does not let an author override — an author who could name the variable could name
it something the adapter never reads, and the failure would look like a broken channel rather
than a misconfiguration. Values live in the agent's own ``.env``, which NOVA never writes.
