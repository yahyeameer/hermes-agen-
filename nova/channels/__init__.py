"""NOVA Channel Layer — the customer's channels, connected to their AI workforce.

The runtime underneath already has a complete messaging platform system: adapters,
a registry, channel→agent routing, default-deny access control, webhook signature
verification and a durable outbound delivery ledger. ``docs/NOVA_CHANNEL_AUDIT.md`` records
what was found and where.

**So this package writes no adapter, no transport and no protocol code.** It owns the four
things the runtime deliberately does not: the tenant boundary, the per-connection grant that
says which agents a channel may reach, the customer's vocabulary, and the audit record of
who connected what. Everything else is compiled into configuration for a system that works.
