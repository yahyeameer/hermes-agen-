"""Who is calling the control plane, and what they may see.

Before this, the control plane had one shared bearer token and no concept of a caller. That
is enough to keep strangers out and not enough to run a deployment: there is no per-user
audit, no read/approve separation, and no way to revoke one person's access without
rotating everyone's.

It matters more than it looks, because the control plane is where a human will eventually
*approve* an escalated business action. An approval gate with no identity cannot record who
approved, and an approval nobody can be held to is not a control.

**This is deliberately not OIDC.** NOVA loads with the standard library and PyYAML, and an
identity provider is a dependency, a deployment, and a failure mode. What is here is the
abstraction OIDC would slot into — a :class:`Principal` resolved from a credential, with
routes gated on its role — so adding a real IdP later replaces :func:`authenticate` and
touches nothing else.

**Tokens are stored hashed.** The file NOVA reads holds SHA-256 digests, never the tokens
themselves. A leaked principals file is then an inconvenience rather than an incident, and
it means NOVA never holds a credential in the clear — the same rule the deployment seam is
built on, applied to NOVA's own front door.
