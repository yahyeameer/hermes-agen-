"""A thin HTTP transport for the Control API.

Built on the standard library so the platform layer keeps its zero-dependency surface.
The handlers in :mod:`nova.control.api` hold all the behaviour; this module only moves
bytes, which is what makes swapping in a production server later a contained change
rather than a rewrite.

Safety properties, all tested:

**Writes are a declared surface, not an open door.** POST is served only for the routes in
``auth.WRITE_ROUTES``; PUT, PATCH and DELETE are refused with 405 before any handler runs.
An undeclared write path is a 404, not an admin-only 403 — forgetting to declare a read
exposes data, and forgetting to declare a write hands out an action.

**Cross-site requests cannot act.** A loopback caller is a local admin, which was harmless
while everything was a read and is not harmless now: any page in the operator's browser can
make their browser POST to ``127.0.0.1``. Three things stop it, and each blocks a different
technique — a JSON content type (an HTML form cannot send one), a same-origin check on any
``Origin`` header, and no CORS preflight answer at all (so a scripted cross-origin fetch
never gets to send the real request).

**No accidental exposure.** Binding to anything other than loopback requires both
authentication and transport security. A control plane that lists a customer's agents and
work must not become world-readable because someone passed ``--host 0.0.0.0`` while
debugging, and a bearer token crossing a VPC in cleartext is not much better than no token.

**Every caller is a principal.** Authentication resolves a named :class:`~nova.control.auth.Principal`
with a role, and each route declares the minimum role it needs, so the access log records
*who* read what rather than only that someone did.
