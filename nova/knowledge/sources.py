"""What a knowledge source is, and which files belong to it.

A source is declared once per tenant, in ``knowledge.yaml``, and referenced by id from any
number of agents. The declaration is deliberately narrow — a root directory, glob filters,
a size cap and a classification label — because everything it does not say is something a
customer cannot get wrong.

The walk below is the security boundary of the whole capability. Everything downstream
assumes the file it is handed is one the tenant meant to publish, so this module refuses
rather than guesses: no symlinks, no paths that resolve outside the declared root, no files
above the cap, nothing from a dot-directory.
