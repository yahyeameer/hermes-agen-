"""Whether a materialized agent has the credentials it needs to actually run.

NOVA writes the *name* of every variable an agent needs and never the value, so there is a
gap by design between "configured" and "runnable". This closes it the only way NOVA honestly
can: by reporting, precisely, which variables are missing and which file the operator has to
put them in.

The alternative — writing the secret — is the one thing this whole design exists to avoid.
The other alternative, saying nothing, produces an agent that materializes cleanly and fails
on its first task with a provider error at whatever hour the first task runs.

Resolution mirrors the runtime's own order, verified in
``hermes_cli/env_loader.py::load_hermes_dotenv`` and
``agent/auxiliary_client.py::_scoped_key_env``:

    <profile>/.env   ->   the process environment

``<profile>/.env`` is checked first because it is what the runtime loads with
``override=True``, and it is the file NOVA is forbidden from writing — which makes it
exactly the right place for the operator to own.
