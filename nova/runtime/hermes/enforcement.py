"""The policy enforcement plugin, as installed into the runtime.

This file is **copied verbatim** into each agent's profile as the plugin entry point. It
runs inside a worker process, not inside NOVA, so it imports nothing from NOVA and
nothing from the runtime — only the standard library and its sibling ``_decide`` module,
which is a verbatim copy of :mod:`nova.policy.decide`.

It implements ``pre_tool_call``, the runtime's documented policy hook: returning
``{"action": "block", "message": ...}`` vetoes a call, and ``{"action": "approve", ...}``
escalates it to the same human gate that guards dangerous shell commands — which fails
closed when no human is present.

**Every failure path here blocks.** A policy that cannot be read, a decision that raises,
a document with an unknown schema: all produce a refusal. A governance control that fails
open is not a control, and a worker that is too restricted fails loudly and visibly,
while one that is silently unrestricted does not.
