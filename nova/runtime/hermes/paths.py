"""Where the Hermes runtime keeps its state, resolved without importing Hermes.

Resolution order is the alias chain from the boundary document: a NOVA-specific location
wins when set, and the Hermes locations remain fully supported so an existing
installation keeps working untouched.

    $NOVA_HOME  ->  ~/.nova  ->  $HERMES_HOME  ->  ~/.hermes

Deliberately re-implemented rather than importing ``hermes_constants.get_hermes_home``:
importing it would pull the runtime into NOVA's import graph and invert the dependency
arrow the architecture depends on. The cost is this function; the benefit is that
``nova`` imports with only PyYAML present.
