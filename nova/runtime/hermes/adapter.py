#: What the Hermes runtime provides, as established by the Phase 0 audit.
#:
#: ``tool_scoping`` is True because tool DENIALS compile to the runtime's unconditional
#: deny list and are genuinely enforced ahead of any bypass. Positive scoping
#: (toolsets/allow) is not yet compiled — see ``materialize.warnings_for`` for why — and
#: the materializer warns whenever a spec declares it.
#: ``knowledge_retrieval`` is True: a granted agent gets a ``knowledge_search`` tool
#: installed as a per-agent plugin, scoped in SQL to the corpora its tenant granted it.
#: Plugin toolsets are enabled by default (``hermes_cli/tools_config.py``), so the tool
#: reaches the model without NOVA writing ``platform_toolsets`` — the key it deliberately
#: does not touch.
#: ``document_extraction`` is True because the runtime ships extractors for PDF, Office and
#: OpenDocument formats, which NOVA borrows rather than reimplements (see ``extract.py``).
#: ``work_submission`` is True: NOVA creates tasks through ``kanban_db.create_task`` — the
#: runtime's own API for its own shared board, which is a different database from the
#: conversation and credential state on ``materialize.NEVER_WRITE``.
#: ``policy_enforcement`` is True: policy compiles to a plugin on the runtime's documented
#: pre-tool-call hook, which vetoes a call or escalates it to the same human gate that
#: guards dangerous shell commands — and that gate fails closed with no human present.
#: ``channel_delivery`` is True: the runtime ships 22 messaging platform adapters behind a
#: documented plugin seam, routes a conversation to a profile through ``gateway.profile_routes``,
#: and refuses a route whose target profile it does not serve. NOVA compiles its declaration
#: into that configuration and writes no adapter, no transport and no protocol code.
#: ``work_decisions`` is True: the runtime already has a review gate and an operator
#: promotion path (``request_changes``, ``promote_task``, ``unblock_task``, ``add_comment``),
#: each with its own state machine and its own event rows. NOVA asks for a transition and
#: lets the runtime refuse an illegal one, rather than writing a status itself.
