"""Reported model usage, read-only.

**This is observation, not control.** Nothing here enforces anything, and nothing here
can: the runtime's LLM-call hooks discard their return values, so no plugin can veto a
model call. Token and cost figures are reportable and never a ceiling.

Two caveats travel with every figure and are carried in :class:`UsageSummary` rather than
left to documentation:

*Lagging* — the runtime writes usage through a coalescing background thread, so a reading
taken now can trail the true figure.

*Estimated* — ``estimated_cost_usd`` is the runtime's own arithmetic, not an invoice.
Reconcile against the provider's billing before anyone is charged.
