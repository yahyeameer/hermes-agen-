"""What an interrupted run left behind, and what to do about it.

NOVA's audit log is write-ahead: an intent is recorded before a model-visible change and a
commit after it. That design exists to make a crash *recoverable*, and until now only half
of it was built — the CLI counted unfinished intents and printed a warning. Nothing
established what had actually happened, so an operator was told "a previous run was
interrupted" and left to work out what that meant for a customer's deployment.

The recovery is deliberately **diagnosis, not repair**. An unfinished intent means the
outcome is unknown, and the honest response to an unknown is to find out — not to guess and
act. So this compares the intent against the current state and says which of three things is
true:

``resolved``    the change is present and correct; the crash was between the write and the
                commit record, and re-running would be a no-op.
``incomplete``  the change is absent or partial; re-running will finish it.
``unknown``     the subject no longer exists, or the kind is not one that can be checked
                against state.

Only the second is a call to action, and the action is ``nova apply`` — which is idempotent,
already audited, and the thing an operator would have run anyway. NOVA does not need a
second, less-tested write path to clean up after the first.
