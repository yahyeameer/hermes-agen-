"""Append-only audit log.

**The invariant: model-visible means logged.** Any change to state that a model will
later see — an agent's instructions, its tools, its model, the branding wrapped around
its replies — must be recorded in this log *before* it takes effect, and the record must
be sufficient to reconstruct what changed.

Enforced structurally rather than by convention: model-visible changes are performed
through :meth:`AuditLog.model_visible_change`, which writes an ``intent`` record, runs
the change, and then writes ``committed`` or ``failed``. A crash between the two leaves
an open intent — which is the point. An unexplained intent in the log is a question
worth asking; a silent change is not even a question.

Storage is JSONL, one event per line, opened in append mode and flushed per write. It is
deliberately not SQLite: the log must survive and stay readable when the runtime's own
storage is the thing that broke, and ``tail -f`` is a feature during an incident.
