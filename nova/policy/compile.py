"""Fold an agent's spec and the tenant policy into one compiled document.

Compilation is where declarations become enforceable. It is also where contradictions
surface: an agent denying a tool its own permission grants, or denying a baseline tool it
needs to report work. Those are reported as warnings at build time, because the
alternative is discovering them when a task runs and never closes.

The compiled document is deliberately a plain dictionary of tool names — no NOVA types,
no indirection — so the enforcement point inside the runtime can read it with nothing but
the standard library.
