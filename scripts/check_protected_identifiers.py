"""Fail when a protected upstream identifier has been renamed, or a boundary crossed.

The NOVA platform layer lives alongside an upstream runtime that we merge from. Three
classes of mistake would be expensive and are each hard to spot in review:

1. **A renamed protected identifier.** Environment variables, on-disk paths, wire
   headers, entry-point groups and module names that existing installations, third-party
   plugins or the upstream project depend on.
2. **A renamed model identifier.** ``Hermes-4-405B`` and friends are *large language
   models*, not this runtime. Renaming one breaks model resolution and surfaces as a 404
   from an inference provider rather than as a failing test. This is the single most
   likely expensive mistake, so it is checked separately and absolutely.
3. **An inverted dependency.** Upstream code importing ``nova`` would make every future
   upstream merge a conflict, and would break a runtime that has no NOVA installed.

Run: ``python scripts/check_protected_identifiers.py``
Exit 1 with a file:line list on any violation.
